This paper presents **Calcite** under Apache Foundation, an extensible framework for query processing, optimization and query language support to different data processing systems. It consists of a query optimizer with rule-based optimization, a query processor supporting multiple query languages, an adapter architecture to support various data models and stores.

The authors first introduces the motivation behind Calcite. Nowadays, people have been developing specialized data processing systems. The "one size fits all" paradigm (for SQL) has gone away. Although these systems have different logics, most still need to support some common features influenced by SQL. To save efforts, it is important to have a unifying framework to solve this problem. Specifically, Calcite helps to address the implementation of 3 components, query execution engine, query optimizer and query languages. However, Calcite leaves other components (such as the storage layer) to the logics of specific systems. Notice that Calcite has a very similar vision to Volcano, a framework proposed in the 90s.

The paper then compares Calcite with other similar frameworks. Compared to them, Calcite can be used as a standalone query execution engine & optimizer that can be used with different storage and processing backends. Its optimizer uses a bottom-up DP-based planning algorithm based on Volcano (and also extended to support multi-stage optimizations as in Orca).

Then, the architecture of Calcite is presented. It contains the following components:

- A query parser and validator: translate a given SQL query into a tree of relational operators.
- An SQL query optimizer: Calcite can convert the optimized result back to an SQL query so that it works as a pluggable, stand-alone system (because the original system can further process based on Calcite's optimization result). Calcite can even help to optimize queries parsed by other systems.

Calcite supports all relational algebra operators, as well as advanced operators such as the window function. It uses _**traits**_ to describe the physical properties associated with an operator. Some common traits include _ordering_, _grouping_ and _partitioning_. There is an important trait called _calling convention_, which represents the data processing system in which the expression will be executed. This helps Calcite to transparently treat queries whose execution would span over different engines. This approach makes it possible to put different systems together and implement a huge federated database system.
